# Security Policy

## Scope and Expectations

- This repository is an educational/demo project and is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind (see LICENSE).
- No SLA: there is no guarantee of response or remediation timelines.
- Not for production use. Derivative or third‑party deployments are out of scope and at your own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Prefer private reporting via GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled for this repo). Alternatively, open a draft PR that demonstrates the fix.
- Please avoid posting exploitable details in public issues.
- Include a clear description, impact, reproduction steps/PoC, and affected files.

## Safe Harbor

We support good‑faith security research. If you:
- Avoid data exfiltration, privacy violations, or service disruption (e.g., no DDoS), and
- Act responsibly and within the scope of this repository,

then we will not pursue legal action for your research activities.

## Supported Versions

- The `main` branch is maintained on a best‑effort basis. No backported fixes are guaranteed.
